# Cobalt BASIC
Cobalt BASIC is a simple programming language with syntax inspired by python and javascript with an aim for readability and understandablility. It is the fastest langauge ever because it is interpreted by python, but it will get the job done for simple tasks
## Files
 - **main.py** 
        - Contains the shell for running programs in my programming language
 - **basic.py** 
        - Contains all the code the actual programming language, including the `lexer`, `parser`, and `interpreter`
 - **string_with_arrows.py**
        - Contains a single method called `string_with_arrows`, for inserting `^` characters where an error appears in my programming language
        - Contains a single method called `string_with_arrows` for inserting `^` characters where an error appears in my programming language

- cd into the directory for the repo
- run `main.py` from your preffered python executor

## Todo list
- [ ] add functions
- [ ] add strings
- [ ] add lists
- [ ] add built in functions

## Credits
The base of this code was written while following this [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD) on youtube. I have added some of my own features and syntax. I plan to go beyond this tutorial series and add even more features as I learn more about this topic.
