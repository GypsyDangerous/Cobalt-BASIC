# Custom python programming language
working, basic programming language interpreted by python
## Files
 - **main.py** 
        - Contains the shell for running programs in my programming language
 - **basic.py** 
        - Contains all the code the actual programming language, including the `lexer`, `parser`, and `interpreter`
 - **string_with_arrows.py**
        - Contains a single method called `string_with_arrows`, for inserting `^` characters where an error appears in my programming language

## Installation
Since this project simply contains python files and doesn't use any modules that don't come with python all you need to down is clone this repo, Open a terminal/shell in that directory and run the `main.py` file to start it.

## Todo list
- [ ] add functions
- [ ] add strings
- [ ] add lists
- [ ] add built in functions
- [ ] add multi-line code compatability
- [ ] add return statement
- [ ] add iterative for loops

## Credits
The base of this code was written while following this [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD) on youtube. I have added some of my own features and syntax. I plan to go beyond this tutorial series and add even more features as I learn more about this topic
