# This is basic documentation to help you get started using Cobalt BASIC

## Variable declaration:
variables can be declared with either the 'let' or 'var' keyword, despite there begin two keywords they
both act the same, they declare a variable that acts the same as a python variable would act.
Once a variable has been declared it can be reassigned within its scope by saying `var_name = new value`.
variables in Cobalt act the same as variables in python would so there type can be changed.
